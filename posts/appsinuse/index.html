<h1>Why I use these apps</h1>

<h2>Ulysses</h2>

<p>Ulysses is my main creative space. I use it to write anything in a project. That is, professional writings such as essays, books, website articles.</p>

<h2>Things</h2>

<p>Things is my personal to-do list app. I also use it with minor personal projects or projects I’m not managing.</p>

<h2>Trello</h2>

<p>Trello is my professional project management app. If a project I manage is too big for Things, I use Trello to manage it instead.</p>

<h2>MindNode</h2>

<p>MindNode is like Ulysses which is also a creative tool. I use MindNode to do brainstorming, with or without peers. I also use it to manage my personal financial accounts because its non-linear structure is more suitable than a word document or a spreadsheet in this case.</p>

<h2>PDF Expert</h2>

<p>PDF Expert is my PDF reader for academic essays and book chapters. I also use it for every other PDFs instead of the built-in Preview app.</p>

<h2>Day One</h2>

<figure><img src="DraggedImage-5.png"/></figure>

<p>Day One is my journaling app. I’m still figuring out if I should use it to journal because sometimes it distracts me to journal on a digital device. However if I’m going to journal on my Apple devices I’m going to use Day One to do that.</p>

<h2>Google Chrome</h2>

<figure><img src="DraggedImage-6.png"/></figure>

<p>When a website is not that compatible with Safari, I use Chrome instead. For example some Flash-powered webpages or web apps like Google Drive.</p>

<h2>1Blocker</h2>

<figure><img src="DraggedImage-7.png"/></figure>

<p>It’s the only ad blocker I use throughout all my Apple devices. It’s efficient and highly customisable. I feel more safe with 1Blocker as well because its business model is one-time purchase.</p>

<h2>DaisyDisk</h2>

<figure><img src="DraggedImage-8.png"/></figure>

<p>I use DaisyDisk to get a whole picture of how my disk is used and to decide which folders to delete.</p>

<h2>TextMate</h2>

<figure><img src="DraggedImage-9.png"/></figure>

<p>TextMate is the plain text editor I use. Unless it’s an RTF file I’m not going to use TextEdit for opening a text file. TextMate has syntax colouring and a command line opener. It also supports Markdown previewing. It opens property list files. It even has version control functions built in. Very useful for a programmer.</p>

<h2>The Unarchiver</h2>

<figure><img src="DraggedImage-10.png"/></figure>

<p>Sometimes the built-in Archive Utility won’t open special archive formats like 7z files. The Unarchiver can unarchive them, that’s all.</p>

<h2>Final Cut Pro</h2>

<figure><img src="DraggedImage-11.png"/></figure>

<p>My video editing software choice because I like the way it handles its library. The Magnetic Timeline is both intuitive and not distracting.</p>
