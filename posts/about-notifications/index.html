<h1>About Notifications</h1>

<p>Containment is a very important concept when dealing with dynamic and huge amount of information. To maintain our personal spaces static, we have to prevent as much as possible the information of the outside world leaking in. For smartphones, those information has a name called <em>notifications</em>.</p>

<p>Started with the pagers, or beepers, human started to develop an intimacy with these electrical notification systems. It is natural for us, especially the digital native ones, to receive a message notification and reply to the notification. So natural that no one thinks there might be a problem behind this behaviour. </p>

<p>In his essay <em>Cybernetics in History</em>, Norbert Wiener proposes the concept of <strong>feedback</strong>, which means that the automated, ‘smart’ machines today have the ability to observe its surroundings in order to give a adjusted respond to the user input. This essentially means that machines started to have subjectivity. Today, machines are having more and more subjectivity everyday, from pager to cellphone to smartphone, their sensors are growing better and their processing ability stronger. Wiener also pointed out that the basis of a cybernetic system is messaging in terms that either communication systems or control systems rely on the transmission of messages. In Wiener’s original concept, human is capable of either being on top of the hierarchy or being a responder, while machine can only be responder. However, in today’s world, machines, or specifically speaking, smartphones have become the ones who give orders and human become the one who respond to orders. In short, we are losing our subjectivity to machines.</p>

<p>How can we retain a certain level of subjectivity? We can start from taking control of the messaging system itself. In the context of smartphones, we decide which notifications we need and which we don’t need. </p>
